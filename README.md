    These is my Bug Bounty Automation project. Basically just a copy where I scrubbed out the discord webhook links so no one could spam my automation alerts channel.

This should work fine if you want to use it yourself, but be mindful to add your own discord webhook links and to edit the /config/Config.py with the correct filepaths, as well as actually create the necessary files.
